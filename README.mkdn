===========

Getting started
---------------

Submitting patches
------------------
Patches are always welcome! Please submit your patches via LineageOS Gerrit!

Simply follow our guide on [how to submit patches](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting-patch-howto.html).

To view the status of your and others' patches, visit [LineageOS Gerrit Code Review](https://review.lineageos.org/).


Buildbot
--------

All supported devices are built weekly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.

You can view the current build statuses at [LineageOS Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/lineageos).

Builds produced weekly by the buildbot can be downloaded from [LineageOS downloads](https://download.lineageos.org/).
